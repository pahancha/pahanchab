### Hi, I'm Pahan üëãüèº

I'm Pahan, a Software Engineer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on an ongoing journey of becomingn a computer scientist and an amateur writer (and hopefully a future novelist!).

I love creating things and documenting the process. I enjoy photography; sometimes I go out with my camera to capture moments. I'm also a stamp collector (yes, really!), pool player, and reader. I love exploring new things and visiting different places. Fun fact: I'm a Level 8 Google Local Guide‚Äîcheck out some of my contributions [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CSp48hMUo7LBPyvm7?g_st=ic).

I‚Äôm also passionate about teaching and sharing what I know.

You can find the source code for this web/blog (and ofc other projects) in my [GitHub](https://github.com/pahancha). By the way, this blog is built with Hugo!
